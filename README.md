## *Brief Description*  
This is a skillet configuring predefined auto tag filter to adjust the security policy on the endpoint’s log.  
## *Target Audience*  
SEs and Partners  
## *Skillet Details*  
Authoring Group:  Datacenter Virtualization  
Documentation:  Docouments about Auto-tag and log forwarding  
[PAN-OS configuration guide about auto tag](https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/pan-os/9-0/pan-os-admin/monitoring/configure-log-forwarding.html)

Github Location:  https://
PAN-OS Supported:  tested version is PAN-OS 9.0  
Cloud Provider(s) Supported:  any Cloud Provider is supported as well as on-premises DCs  
Type of Skillet:  One xml  
Purpose:  Demo  
Status:  draft  

### Detail Description  
This skillet is for SE and Partners and to use a demonstration for customers to understand our auto tag feature. Particularly, in the case that a Datacenter customer wants a NGFW to adjust or tune automatically the security policy/rule with reaction to the endpoint behavior, in order to reduce their maintenance works with huge amount of logs.  

 Auto-tag feature can add a tag in source IP address or destination IP address  filtered using log forwarding’s action with user-defined filter. Particularly, in datacenter use-case it is risky for the customer to take deny action of the servers soon and due to the fact that there would be huge amount of logs, the customer could not investigate to step it to the more strict policy.   
 Automatic stepwise policy would be helpful for  the customer, however it is not easy for some customers to define the filter which endpoints traffic should be raised to next strict policy.  
 This skillet helps the customer deploy the filter easier and helps SEs and Partner provide predefined filters with the customer.  

### How does the skillet works.  
Configure a Tag  
Configure a Dynamic IP address list  
Configure a Log forwarding with some filter and an action adding the Tag with pre-defined filter  
Configure a sampled base-line security policy with the Log warding  
Configure a strict security policy for tagged ip address.
